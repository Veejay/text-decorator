# Linker

## Motivations

The point of this repo is to think about how to best format the HTML we're sending to the client so that we don't add the links ourselves in the backend.

The strategy we choose should be totally independent of the representation of a link frontend developers might choose. 
Since the codebase is javascript/TypeScript, it allows us to devise ways to make it easy to deal with intercompatibility.
